Scheduling Jenkins jobs can be done through the built-in functionality that Jenkins provides. You can set up cron-like schedules for jobs using the "Build Triggers" feature. This is useful if you want to run a Jenkins job at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, hourly, etc.).

Hereâ€™s how you can schedule a Jenkins job:

Example 1: Schedule a Jenkins Job Using Cron Syntax
1. Navigate to your Jenkins Job: Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on the job you want to schedule.
   
2. Configure the Job: Click on the Configure option on the left-hand side.

3. Scroll to Build Triggers: Look for the Build Triggers section.

4. Enable Cron Schedule:
   - Check the box next to Build periodically.

5. Set the Cron Expression:
   - You'll see a text box where you can enter a cron expression. 
   - The syntax follows the cron format `MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW` (Minute, Hour, Day of Month, Month, Day of Week).

Example of a Cron Schedule:
To run a job every day at 2:30 AM, you would use:

30 2 * * *

This means:
- 30 = 30th minute
- 2 = 2nd hour (i.e., 2 AM)
- \* = every day of the month
- \* = every month
- \* = every day of the week

#Example Schedules:
1. Every 15 minutes:
   */15 * * * *

2. Every Sunday at 5 AM:
   0 5 * * 0

3. Every first day of the month at midnight:
   0 0 1 * *
