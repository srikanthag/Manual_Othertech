Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used to automate repetitive tasks in the software development lifecycle. It is primarily used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Jenkins enables developers to automatically build, test, and deploy software, which streamlines and accelerates the development process.

Key Features of Jenkins:
1. Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins is used to automatically trigger builds whenever code changes are made in the source repository. It helps detect integration issues early by testing the application frequently.
  
2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Jenkins automates the delivery pipeline, pushing code to production environments or staging servers with minimal manual intervention, improving speed and reliability.

3. Extensibility: Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins that allow it to integrate with various tools and services, including version control systems (Git, SVN), build tools (Maven, Gradle), testing tools (JUnit), and deployment tools (Docker, Kubernetes).

4. Distributed Builds: Jenkins can distribute workloads across multiple machines, which helps to handle large-scale projects efficiently.

5. User Interface: Jenkins provides a web-based interface for managing builds, configuring jobs, and monitoring project statuses.

Key Components of Jenkins:
- Master: The main Jenkins server responsible for managing the Jenkins environment. It schedules jobs and monitors their execution.
- Slave/Agent: Remote machines that can be used to offload the execution of builds. These help in distributing the load of builds and tests.
- Jobs: A single task, such as a build, that Jenkins can execute. Jobs can be configured to run on a schedule or triggered by specific events (like a code commit).

Common Jenkins Use Cases:
- Automated Testing: Jenkins can automatically run tests every time new code is committed, ensuring that the software is always in a deployable state.
- Build Automation: Jenkins automates the process of compiling and packaging code, making it faster and more reliable.
- Deployment Automation: Jenkins can push applications to staging or production environments automatically after the build and tests pass.

Jenkins has a large community of users and developers, which makes it well-supported and continuously evolving. Its flexibility and plugin ecosystem make it an essential tool in modern DevOps practices.
